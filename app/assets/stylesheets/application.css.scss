 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will

 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets, or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any,
 * can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the bottom of the compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence
 * over styles defined in any styles defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this
 * directory. It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
